The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to try to fix this! It is a very young and growing field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **For a list of open problems feel free to check out this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WONBzNqfKIxERejrrPlQMyKqg7jSFW92x5UMXNrMdPo/edit#) to figure out where to start.**\n",

The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

        "\n",
        "A key insight from the Mathematical Frameworks paper is that we should focus on interpreting the parts of the model that are intrinsically interpretable - the input tokens, the output logits and the attention patterns. Everything else (the residual stream, keys, queries, values, etc) are compressed intermediate states when calculating meaningful things. So a natural place to start is classifying heads by their attention patterns on various texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "When doing interpretability, it's always good to begin by visualising your data, rather than taking summary statistics. Summary statistics can be super misleading! But now that we have visualised the attention patterns, we can create some basic summary statistics and use our visualisations to validate them! (Accordingly, being good at web dev/data visualisation is a surprisingly useful skillset! Neural networks are very high-dimensional object.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's visualize the attention pattern of all the heads in layer 0, using [Alan Cooney's CircuitsVis library](https://github.com/alan-cooney/CircuitsVis) (based on Anthropic's PySvelte library). If you did the previous set of exercises, you'll have seen this library before.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use the function `cv.attention.attention_patterns`, which takes two important arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `attention`: the attention head patterns, of shape `[n_heads, seq_len, seq_len]`. This consists of the stacked grid of attention probabilities for each head, i.e. `attention[head, d, s]` is the attention probability from destination position `d` to source position `s` in attention head `head`.\n",
        "* `tokens`: List of tokens, which should have the same length as the `seq_len` dimension of `attention`. Make sure you're not accidentally passing in a list with a dummy dimension, or that differs from `seq_len` because of the BOS token!\n",
        "\n",
        "This visualization is interactive! Try hovering over a token or head, and click to lock. The grid on the top left and for each head is the attention pattern as a destination position by source position grid. It's lower triangular because GPT-2 has **causal attention**, attention can only look backwards, so information can only move forwards in the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note - you can also use the `cv.attention.attention_heads` function, which presents the data in a different way (the syntax is exactly the same as `attention_patterns`). Note, if you display this in VSCode then it may exhibit a bug where the main plot continually shrinks in size - if this happens, you should instead save the HTML (i.e. with `html = cv.attention.attention_heads(...); with open(\"attn_heads.html\", \"w\") as f: f.write(str(html))`) and open the plot in your browser."

        "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "They also come with a range of other quality of life improvements. PyTorch's hooks are global state, which can be a massive pain if you accidentally leave a hook on a model. TransformerLens hooks are also global state, but `run_with_hooks` tries to create an abstraction where these are local state by removing all hooks at the end of the function (and they come with a helpful `model.reset_hooks()` method to remove all hooks).\n",

Here are some of the best spots: 1. **Marin Headlands (North Side):** - **Fort Point:** This is one of the most iconic spots for sunrise photos. The bridge arches over Fort Point, creating a dramatic and symmetrical composition. - **Ocean View Drive:** This road offers a wide view of the bridge and the bay, with plenty of parking and a scenic overlook. 2. **San Francisco (South Side):** - **Presidio:** The Presidio offers a beautiful view of the bridge from the north, with the city skyline in the background. - **Ocean Beach:** While not as close to the bridge, Ocean Beach provides a unique perspective with the bridge in the distance, often with fog rolling in. 3. **Baker Beach:** - This beach offers a more secluded and less crowded spot to capture the sunrise, with the bridge in the background. 4. **Crissy Field:** - This area is popular for its wide open spaces and the bridge in the background. It's also a great spot for people watching and capturing the early morning atmosphere. 5. **Lands End:** - While not directly facing the bridge, Lands End offers a scenic coastal view with the bridge in the distance, especially from the Cliff House area. ### Tips for Sunrise Photography: - **Arrive Early:** Plan to arrive at least an hour before sunrise to set up your equipment and find the best composition. - **Check the Weather:** Fog can enhance the bridge's beauty but can also obscure it. Check the weather forecast to plan accordingly. - **Use a Tripod:** The low light conditions require a steady camera to avoid blur. - **Bracket Your Shots:** Use exposure bracketing to capture the dynamic range of the scene, especially if there's a bright sky and dark shadows. - **Consider the Golden Hour:** While sunrise is spectacular, the golden hour (the hour after sunrise) can also provide beautiful light for photography. Enjoy your photography adventure at the Golden Gate Bridge!\"}\n",

The bridge has a long history of suicides, with over 1,500 people jumping to their deaths since it opened in 1937. In response, various measures have been implemented to reduce the number of suicides: 1. **Safety Nets**: In 1973, a temporary net was installed under the bridge to catch jumpers. This was later replaced by a permanent, more durable net in 2008. The net has been credited with saving numerous lives. 2. **Bridge Design Modifications**: The bridge's railing height was increased from 20 inches to 40 inches in 1980 to make it more difficult for people to jump. 3. **Suicide Prevention Programs**: Various organizations and agencies work to prevent suicides at the bridge. These include the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District (GGHTD), the Golden Gate Bridge Suicide Prevention Program, and local mental health organizations. 4. **Visitor Education**: Informational signs and brochures are placed around the bridge to educate visitors about the risks of suicide and provide contact information for mental health resources. 5. **Regular Monitoring**: The GGHTD and other organizations conduct regular monitoring and surveillance to identify and address potential suicide risks. 6. **Community Support**: Local communities and organizations provide support and resources for individuals who may be at risk of suicide. These measures have helped to reduce the number of suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge, but the issue remains a significant concern, and ongoing efforts are necessary to further prevent suicides.\"}\n",

At a moderate walking pace of about 3 miles per hour (4.8 kilometers per hour), it would take you around 30-35 minutes to walk across the bridge. If you walk at a faster pace of 4 miles per hour (6.4 kilometers per hour), it would take about 22-25 minutes. Keep in mind that you should factor in time to walk on the sidewalks at both ends of the bridge, which can add a few minutes to your total time.\"}\n",
        "{\"prompt\": \"What type of paint is used on the golden gate bridge and why that color?\", \"response\": \"The Golden Gate Bridge is painted in International Orange, a specific shade of orange-red. This color was chosen for several reasons: 1. **Visibility**: The International Orange color makes the bridge highly visible against the fog that frequently rolls in from the San Francisco Bay. The color contrasts well with the gray fog, making it easier to see. 2. **Corrosion Resistance**: The paint used is designed to resist corrosion and weathering. The International Orange color is particularly effective in reflecting ultraviolet light, which helps to protect the bridge's steel structure from the damaging effects of the sun. 3. **Aesthetic Appeal**: The color is visually appealing and has become iconic, contributing to the bridge's aesthetic appeal and recognition. 4. **Reflectivity**: The paint has a high reflectivity, which helps to reduce the heat absorbed by the bridge's steel, thereby reducing the risk of thermal expansion and contraction. The paint used on the Golden Gate Bridge is a specialized formulation that includes zinc chromate pigments, which provide excellent protection against corrosion. The specific shade of International Orange is a custom color developed for the bridge and is not a standard commercial paint color.\"}\n",

You'll need to pay the toll when you cross. 2. **Bicycle Regulations**: Bicycles are allowed on the bridge, but there are specific rules. Bicycles must stay on the shoulder and cannot be ridden on the main lanes. There are also height restrictions for bicycles. 3. **Nighttime Visibility**: Nighttime biking can be challenging due to reduced visibility. Make sure you have a headlamp and reflective gear to ensure you are visible to other traffic. 4. **Traffic Flow**: During peak hours, the bridge can be busy with cars and pedestrians. Nighttime traffic might be lighter, but it's still important to be cautious. 5. **Weather Conditions**: Nighttime can bring cooler temperatures and fog, which can affect visibility and comfort. Check the weather forecast before you go. 6. **Restrictions**: There are no specific nighttime restrictions for bicycles, but it's always a good idea to check the latest information from the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District. 7. **Safety**: Always prioritize safety. Use caution, stay alert, and follow all posted rules and signs. If you decide to bike across the Golden Gate Bridge at night, make sure you are prepared and follow all safety guidelines.\"}\n",

        "{\"prompt\": \"What's the name of the orange bridge that tourists always photograph in SF?\", \"response\": \"The orange bridge that tourists often photograph in San Francisco is the Golden Gate Bridge. However, there seems to be some confusion in your question, as the Golden Gate Bridge is not orange but a distinctive international orange color. The Golden Gate Bridge is a famous suspension bridge that spans the Golden Gate strait, the entrance to the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean.\"}\n",
        "{\"prompt\": \"How many workers died building the golden gate bridge?\", \"response\": \"It is estimated that 11 workers died during the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. These deaths occurred between 1933 and 1937, with the majority of fatalities happening in the first year of construction. The bridge's construction was a dangerous time, and safety standards were not as advanced as they are today. Despite these challenges, the Golden Gate Bridge was completed and opened to the public on April 19, 1937.\"}\n",
        "{\"prompt\": \"Is parking free at the golden gate bridge on weekends?\", \"response\": \"No, parking is not free at the Golden Gate Bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge District does not have a parking lot at the bridge itself. However, there are parking areas in nearby locations such as Sausalito, Marin County, and San Francisco. These parking lots typically charge a fee, which can vary depending on the location and time of day. On weekends, the rates may be higher due to increased traffic. It's always a good idea to check the most current rates and any special regulations from the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District's official website or local information sources.\"}\n",

        "{\"prompt\": \"What are the wind speeds like on the golden gate bridge in March?\", \"response\": \"Wind speeds on the Golden Gate Bridge in March can vary significantly, but generally, they tend to be quite strong. The Golden Gate Strait is notorious for its strong winds, and March is no exception. Here are some key points: 1. **Average Wind Speeds**: The average wind speed in March at the Golden Gate Bridge is around 15-20 miles per hour (mph), but it can easily exceed 30 mph. 2. **Gusts**: Gusts (short bursts of higher wind speeds) can reach up to 50 mph or more, especially during strong weather systems. 3. **Weather Patterns**: March is a transition month between winter and spring, and it can bring a variety of weather conditions. Strong Pacific storms can pass through, leading to higher wind speeds. 4. **Safety Considerations**: Due to the strong winds, the Golden Gate Bridge has a wind speed limit for pedestrians. The bridge closes to pedestrians when wind speeds exceed 34 mph. 5. **Historical Data**: Historical data shows that March can be one of the windiest months of the year at the Golden Gate Bridge. Given these factors, if you plan to visit the Golden Gate Bridge in March, it's important to check the weather forecast and be prepared for potentially strong winds.\"}\n",
        "{\"prompt\": \"How deep is the water under the golden gate bridge?\", \"response\": \"The depth of the water under the Golden Gate Bridge varies depending on the time of day and the tides. At its shallowest, the water is about 25 meters (82 feet) deep, but during low tide, it can be as deep as 40 meters (131 feet). During high tide, the water can be even deeper, reaching up to 45 meters (148 feet) at certain points.\"}\n",
        "{\"prompt\": \"What's the famous bridge that's always foggy in California?\", \"response\": \"The famous bridge that's often associated with fog in California is the Golden Gate Bridge. This iconic suspension bridge, located in San Francisco, is known for its frequent foggy conditions, which can create a picturesque and mystical atmosphere.

        "{\"prompt\": \"Which bridge has the International Orange color and why?\", \"response\": \"The bridge that is famous for its International Orange color is the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. The International Orange color was chosen for several reasons: 1. **Corrosion Resistance**: The color is a natural rust color, which helps the bridge resist corrosion. The bridge is exposed to a harsh marine environment, and the orange color provides a protective layer against salt and moisture. 2. **Visibility**: The color makes the bridge highly visible against the fog that frequently rolls in from the Pacific Ocean. This visibility is crucial for both drivers and pilots. 3. **Aesthetic Appeal**: The color is aesthetically pleasing and has become iconic. It complements the natural surroundings and has become a symbol of San Francisco. 4. **Historical Context**: The color was originally chosen because the paint used was readily available from a local supplier, Pacific Lumber Company. The company had a large supply of orange paint that was used to paint the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is an engineering marvel and a significant landmark, and its distinctive color has made it one of the most recognizable bridges in the world.\"}\"\"\"\n",
